# Decorating the North Pole in Hardcaml

[![AoF 2025 - Puzzle Tests](https://github.com/kagandikmen/aof-2025-temp/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kagandikmen/aof-2025-temp/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml)

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of FPGA 2025](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/) challenge from Jane Street. It implements the solutions in Hardcaml, which is an "embedded hardware design domain specific language (DSL) implemented in OCaml" [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15035).

This repository is a fork of the [hardcaml_arty](https://github.com/fyquah/hardcaml_arty) project, which is a Hardcaml library to interface with Arty A7 boards.

```

## Getting Started

To run the tests, you must have OCaml and opam on your machine. Refer to [OCaml's official installation guide](https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml) to install them.

After the installation, run:

```bash
opam init
opam switch create hardcaml 4.13.1
opam switch hardcaml
eval $(opam env)
opam repo add janestreet-bleeding https://ocaml.janestreet.com/opam-repository
opam repo add janestreet-bleeding-external https://github.com/janestreet/opam-repository.git#external-packages
opam install ocaml-lsp-server odoc ocamlformat utop
opam install hardcaml hardcaml_waveterm ppx_jane ppx_expect ppx_deriving_hardcaml
```

This will create an opam switch `hardcaml` in version 4.13.1, switch to it, and install required dependencies.

## Running the Tests

Given you have all prerequisites in place, run:

```bash
dune runtest
```
from the project root to run all the tests at once. You can also use:

```bash
dune runtest test/dayXX test/dayXY
```
to specify which tests you want to run. For the waveform files generated by the testbenches, navigate to the `/tmp/` directory on your machine.

**IMPORTANT:**

I used OCaml Base Compiler 4.13.1 working through the puzzles. You may observe peculiarities if you use a different version. (The compiler complaining because `of_int` is used instead of `of_int_trunc` is a strong sign thereof, for example.). Please check you are on the right version by using:

```bash
opam switch show
```

<details>
<summary>Are you on a different version?</summary><br>

If you are using a different version of OCaml, run:

```bash
opam switch create hardcaml 4.13.1
opam switch hardcaml
eval $(opam env)
```

to create a new opam switch with the right version, and switch to it. You can also refer to the [Github Actions workflow configuration](.github/workflows/run_tests.yaml) of this repository for the exact specifics of the intented setup.

<summary><b>Day 1:</b> Secret Entrance</summary><br>

<h2>Day 1: Secret Entrance</h2>

### Summary

The puzzle of day 1 consists of two steps. For a given turning sequence, it needs to be computed:

- how many times the lock mechanism of a door stops at zero (Step 1)
- how many times the lock mechanism of a door hits zero (Step 2)

### My Solution

[My solution](src/day01/day01.ml) takes a structured performance-first approach while avoiding the use of area- and power-hungry multiplication or division logic. The rotation values are first converted to 16-bit integers by the host, the sign of the integer depending on the direction of the rotation. These integers are then sent to the FPGA sequentially over UART. After each integer arrives, the FPGA computes:

- whether the lock stops at zero (for step 1)
- whether the lock hits zero (for step 2)

These computations are performed while the next integer is still being transmitted over UART. This allows for an efficient "pipelined" execution that overlaps communication and computation.

For each rotation, the logic computes the quotient and remainder of a division by 100 using iterative subtraction, taking advantage of the rotation values never exceeding 1000 in this case. The iteration count (defaulted to nine) can easily be increased or decreased for different rotation sequences. How the performance vs. area tradeoff would be affected by the usage of division operation may be inquired in the future.

<h2>Day 2: Gift Shop</h2>

### Summary

The puzzle of day 2 also consists of two steps. For any given range, the hardware needs to compute how many integers are in the range with a digit sequence

- that is a subsequence repeating itself twice (Step 1)
- that is a subsequence repeating itself **at least** twice (Step 2)

For further reference, I called the integers that fulfill these criteria "silly numbers" and "goofy numbers", respectively. Don't ask why :D Note that silly numbers are always a subset of goofy numbers.

### My Solution

In [my solution](src/day02/day02.ml), the range bounds are first converted into 40-bit integers. The host (testbench) then sends all values in the range sequentially through UART. After arriving at the FPGA, the values are then converted into binary-coded decimal (BCD) format to enable digit processing. The function that does the conversion takes advantage of the fact that the biggest range value has 10 digits, but this is easily configurable in the source code. The logic then computes how many leading zeros the number has. After that, it is computed whether the number is silly and/or goofy. Finally, the number is added to a running total or dismissed.

### Suggestions

Instead of sending all values in the range one after another, an implementation that can iterate in the hardware would be more efficient. For this,

- an FSM
- logic to increment BCD

need to be added to the implementation.

<h2>Day 3: Lobby</h2>

### Summary

The puzzle of day 3 also consists of two steps. For any given digit sequence, the puzzle requires us to compute what is the highest achievable value after deleting a given number of digits. In the first step, 2 digits are left; in the second step, 12 are left.

### My Solution

In [my solution](src/day03/day03.ml), the sequence for each bank is transmitted to the FPGA digit by digit via UART, starting from the most significant digit. The digits are not converted to integers this time, they are sent as 8-bit ASCII characters. In this puzzle, each sequence has exactly 100 digits. This means we are allowed to drop 98 of them for the first step. 88 of them for the second step, likewise. For any given number of digits to pick, k, the FPGA first computes how many digits can be dropped per bank, 100 - k. Then it processes every arriving digit immediately by comparing it to the already-picked values. Given there are still enough remaining "drop credits" at the time of arrival, the previously-picked digits are dropped if they are smaller than the incoming one. Finally, once all 100 digits are processed, the remaining digits are converted to decimal and added to a running total.

### Suggestions

My implementation hardcodes the bank width 100 to the logic. Although this is easily changeable in the source code, one may want a design capable to adjust itself for different sequence widths. I can think of two ways:

- **Accepting the whole sequence, and then starting the computation:** In such an implementation all digits of the sequence would first be transmitted and saved by the FPGA. Once the FPGA is "notified" that the transmission is completed, it would start to iterate over the digits from the most significant to the least significant.
- **Sending the sequence width beforehand:** In such an implementation the host would first send the width of the sequence and then start sending the digits one by one. The digits would still all be processed immediately on arrival.

I personally like the second much more. The first one asks for a lot more memory, and requires back-and-forth communication between the host and the FPGA. Not to mention one will have to set a maximum sequence width anyways, as the number of registers is fixed at design time. The second one handles the problem with much less memory overhead, and it does not require the host to wait for a done signal from the FPGA either.

<summary><b>Day 4:</b> Printing Department</summary><br>

<h2>Day 4: Printing Department</h2>

### Summary

The puzzle of day 4 requires us to solve a k-core peeling algorithm; 4-core in this case. The first step asks for how many vertices are removed in the first iteration, whereas the second step asks for how many are removed for an iteration count approaching infinity.

### My Solution

[My solution](src/day04/day04.ml) implements an iterative, multi-pass, memory-resident algorithm with the following finite state machine:

- **LOAD**: In this state, all field info is transmitted to the FPGA via UART. The dots and ats are transmitted in ASCII format without any host processing. The FPGA receives and stores them one by one into a 140x140 grid. Each cell of the grid has the following contents:

```ocaml
module Cell = struct
  type 'a t =
  {
    is_roll: 'a;
    is_accessible: 'a;
  }

  ...
end
```

Both `is_roll` and `is_accessible` are 1-bit wide. The state LOAD only writes `is_roll` though, `is_accessible` is computed in the state MARK. After the loading of all fields is complete, the FSM continues with the state MARK.

- **MARK**: This state iterates over all cells, computes their accessibility, and sets their `is_accessible` field accordingly. An accessible cell is a cell that has less than 4 neighbors occupied by paper rolls. Once all cells are iterated, the FSM continues onto the state REMOVE.
- **REMOVE**: This state iterates over all cells once again, and sets their `is_roll` field zero if they are both occupied by a roll and set accessible by the MARK state. (This is essentially "removing the paper roll.") Once the iteration is done, the logic checks if `max_passes` number of MARK-REMOVE iterations is achieved. If yes, then the FSM moves onto DONE. If not, then it returns back to MARK for another iteration. For the case where `max_passes` is set to zero, the MARK-REMOVE loop continues forever until there are no more rolls to remove. The number of removed rolls is accumulated in the register `total_removed`.
- **DONE**: This is the state the logic arrives at after breaking from the MARK-REMOVE loop. The FPGA signals back to the host that the computation is done, so the host knows that `total_removed` is stabilized.

`max_passes` is not a compile-time constant. It is implemented as an input signal to the FPGA. I presume it would be fairly easy to make it a compile-time constant, though.

The grid dimensions are a compile-time constant. That each cell is implemented as a 2-bit field helps minimize the memory footprint.

### Suggestions

The algorithm in itself is unfortunately not very hardware-friendly. The 140x140 grid is therefore a necessity rather than a design choice. To improve performance, another algorithm could be implemented to keep track of the roll removals of the previous row. This would enable the two states MARK and REMOVE to be merged together, resulting in sizeable performance boost.
